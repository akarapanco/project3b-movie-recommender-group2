// ISA: Your job in this file is to write the full KNN recommendation function.
//     std::vector<int> getRecommendations(
//         int targetUserId,
//         const std::unordered_map<int, User>& users,
//         int k


// You will take the target user, measure how similar they are to every other user,
// pick the closest users, look at the movies those users rated, and recommend
// the movies the target user hasn’t seen yet. The function should return a list
// of movie IDs that you think the target user would like based on similar users.
